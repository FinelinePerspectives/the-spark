This is a webpack project that has been retrofitted with CouchCMS.If you are running the build command, you will find an index.php and index.html file in the build folder.

The index.html file has been retained so that the site can be edited in dev mode. However, if you're uploading anything to the server, you will need to upload the index.php file.
